At [Fence Armor](https://fencearmor.com/), we are dedicated to providing superior quality and long-lasting products, paired with exceptional customer service. Our company was born out of necessity and has grown from a simple, effective post protection guard into a comprehensive post protection system featuring a range of harmonious products.
We understand that specialty products begin with quality materials. That’s why we manufacture and source goods that offer a unique one-stop shopping experience for customers aiming to enhance the life and beauty of any new or existing post. As engineering partners with over 50 years of combined experience, we ensure every detail is meticulously considered.
Environmental responsibility is a key part of our strategic development. We prioritize the use of locally sourced, sustainable materials, such as galvanized steel, in our manufacturing process. This commitment supports both the environment and the economy.
Fence Armor is a family-run business, employing fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters who work together to achieve our goals. Our success is measured by our customer’s satisfaction, and we proudly stand behind our products, one post at a time, every time!
